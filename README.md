# UFC-fights-analysis-Python

## Objective 
UFC is the biggest Mixed Martial Arts organization. I used this dataset, which contains information about every UFC event held from 1993 to 2021, in order to analyze it and verify whether or not there is a variable leading to victory more often than others.

## Data
The dataset can be found on Kaggle at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajeevw/ufcdata

The json file used can be found at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ktochylin/world-countries/data

## Tools
For this project, the following Python libraries were used:
- pandas, for data analysis
- matplotlib, plotly and seaborn for visualizations

## Executing the code
The code is available as a ipynb file in the "scripts" folder.
